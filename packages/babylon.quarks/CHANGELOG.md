# Changelog

All notable changes to the `babylon.quarks` package are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project follows the `quarks.core` 0.x version line.

## [0.17.9] — 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- `ParticleSystem` JSON load — preserve `material` reference from exported metadata
  (`sourceMaterial`) so editor/renderer can resolve shader settings from the effect file.

## [0.17.7] — 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Docs reframed around the in-house `babylon.quarks-editor` effect editor and the Unity
  exporter as the primary authoring workflows, instead of the external quarks.art editor
  (quarks.art-exported JSON still loads fine — same format).
- `babylon.quarks-editor`'s README now documents the `resolveTexture`/`resolveGeometry` host
  callbacks: their per-entry-point signatures (`EffectEditorHost`/`Show()` pass a `Scene` second
  argument, the bare `EffectEditor` component does not) and what happens when they're omitted.

## [0.17.5] — 2026-07-02

### Added

- UMD/CDN bundle `dist/babylon.quarks.umd.min.js` exposing the `BabylonQuarks` global —
  usable in the Babylon.js Playground and plain `<script>` setups. `quarks.core` is bundled in;
  `@babylonjs/core` maps to the `BABYLON` global. `unpkg`/`jsdelivr` fields point to it.
- WebGPU support validated: all render modes (billboard, stretched billboard, mesh, trail)
  create pipelines under `WebGPUEngine` with zero validation errors (GLSL is transpiled to WGSL
  by Babylon automatically). Documented in the README.
- Exported types that the public API referenced but did not export:
  `AdaptivePerformanceOptions`, `AdaptivePerformanceState`, `ParticleSystemJSONParameters`,
  `BabylonMetaData`, `AnimationData`, `QuarksTimelineClip`, `BurstParametersJSON`.
- API documentation generated with TypeDoc, published at
  <https://soullnik.github.io/babylon.quarks-standalone/docs/>.

### Changed

- `SpriteBatch` and `QuarksLoader` pass typed arrays to Babylon `VertexData` directly instead
  of copying them through `Array.from`.
- `BatchedRenderer` internals use typed `ParticleSystem` narrowing instead of `as any` casts
  (public signatures unchanged).

### CI

- npm publishing switched to trusted publishing (OIDC) with provenance.

## [0.17.4] — 2026-05-15

### Changed

- `QuarksLoader` test coverage reworked; demo application restructured (new demos, hero
  background). No functional changes to the package runtime.

## [0.17.3] — 2026-05-13

### Added

- Adaptive performance budget controls on `BatchedRenderer`
  (`configureAdaptivePerformance` / `disableAdaptivePerformance` / `getAdaptivePerformanceState`)
  with per-system quality scaling.

### Performance

- Tightened particle system update and spawn loops.
- Reduced hot-path allocations in renderer batches.
- Fast trail history ring buffers for trail rendering.

### Tests

- Extensive coverage expansion (sprite/trail batch integration, particle system, loader,
  prefab and utility paths) with enforced coverage thresholds.

## [0.17.2] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- `QuarksLoader` marks sub-emitter systems as `onlyUsedByOther` after UUID resolution.
- Custom blending mode handling refined.

### Added

- Tile blending support in shaders (additional UV calculations).

## [0.17.1] — 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Packaging setup for the standalone monorepo (README shipped with the package,
  tarball content checks).

## [0.17.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- Initial public release: a high-performance batched particle system for Babylon.js built on
  `quarks.core` — batched sprite/trail rendering, billboard/stretched/mesh/trail render modes,
  soft particles, texture tile animation, sub-emitters, mesh surface emitter plugin,
  `QuarksLoader` for quarks.art / Unity-exported JSON, `QuarksUtil` helpers.
