# Changelog

All notable changes to the Unity Quarks Exporter are documented here.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Tools → Quarks → Export Folder of Effects to JSON** — batch-export every prefab with a
  `ParticleSystem` under a selected Assets folder; output directory mirrors the source
  subfolder layout.
- Progress bar with cancel support during batch export.
- Public `ExportToFile(GameObject, string)` and `ExportFolder(string assetFolder, string outputFolder)`
  APIs for scripting and CI.

### Changed

- Single-effect export refactored to use `ExportToFile`; behaviour unchanged.

## [0.1.0] — initial release

- Export selected hierarchy to babylon.quarks JSON (Shuriken modules → quarks behaviours).
